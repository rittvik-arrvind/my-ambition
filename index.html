    <p>Hello! My name is Rittvik. I am a student at ProGrad Junior. I am in grade 5. I live in India. My fav color is blue and fav animal is the tiger. I also like to play outdoor games a lot</p>
    <h2>My ambition is to become a software developer.</h2>
    <img id="developer"  style="width: 35%;" src="./assets/developer.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I have always been curious about new technologies.
         How the applications run, games are created. Now that I have started to learn about coding I find
          it interesting and very simple to do. I look forward to creating many applications and games.
